# Instructions

Peer review is a critical step in the process of scientific research. Whether written research is published in a formal academic journal or casually disseminated among colleagues, it almost always goes through some version of peer review. This allows fellow researchers with relevant expertise to assess the soundness, clarity, and overall quality of the methodology, interpretation, and communication. 

For this assignment, I am asking you to review a classmate's data analysis project first draft. Your goal is to provide useful feedback on both major and minor points, in order for the author to improve their project in the final report. You will structure your peer review as a formal peer review for a scientific journal (more details below). This will allow you to get a feel for how research dissemination works!

This assignment is limited to **two pages**, and your written text should use at least 12-point font. See the guidelines below for a list of components that need to be included. You should submit your assignment as a pdf file *without your name attached* so that your comments remain anonymous.

Submit your *Peer Review* on Canvas by 11:59pm on May 26. **Do not discuss your peer review with other students or post questions about your project on the Canvas discussion board.** But, feel free to ask me any questions in person/via Canvas instead!
 
This assignment is is graded on effort/completion.

For example, you might comment on whether the statistical approach is adequate for answering the scientific questions. You can comment on how well they motivate the problem --- do they provide enough background for you to understand how this research fits into the big picture? Are there substantial analyses you feel are missing?**
