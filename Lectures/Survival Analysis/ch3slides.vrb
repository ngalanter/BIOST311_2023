\frametitle{Motivation for regression modeling}
The log-rank test is nice for testing for differences between two groups.

If we have a \textcolor{red}{confounder}, we can even adapt the log-rank test by breaking the confounder into discrete categories. But this is pretty limited when we have multiple confounders.

In addition, we'd like to get some \textcolor{blue}{estimate} of association, rather than just a hypothesis test.

This is where regression modeling comes in!
