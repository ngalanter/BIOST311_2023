## Access and accommodation

- Accessibility is important to me

- If you have established accomodations via DRS, please activite them so we can discuss implementation 

- If you have not yet established services through DRS but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability required accomodations (e.g. mental health, attention related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts) contact DRS at disability.uw.edu
 
- If you are in the process of setting up accomodations also feel free to reach out to see if I can make the course more accessible in the meantime

## Religious Accommodation

- UW has a religious accomodations policy, see syllabus for details

- Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of the quarter

- If anyone is currently observing Ramadan happy to discuss accommodations around that

## Inclusion and Diversity

<font size = 5>

Diverse backgrounds, embodiments and experiences are essential to the critical thinking endeavor at the heart of University education. In SPH, we are expected: 

To respect individual differences, which may include, but are not limited to, age, cultural background, disability, ethnicity, family status, gender, immigration status, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status and veteran status. 

To engage respectfully in the discussion of diverse worldviews and ideologies embedded in course readings, presentations and artifacts, including those course materials that are at odds with personal beliefs and values. 

To encourage students with concerns about classroom climate to talk to their instructor, adviser, a member of the departmental or SPH EDI Committee, the Assistant Dean for EDI, or the program’s director. 
 
</font> 

## Pronouns

- We share our pronouns because we strive to cultivate an inclusive environment where people of all genders feel safe and respected

- We cannot assume we know someone’s gender just by looking at them

- So, I invite everyone to share their pronouns

## Bias and Sexual Harrassment Concerns

- See the syllabus for resources for reporting bias incidents and/or sexual harrassment

- I am also available to discuss concerns with and/or direct you to resources

# Motivation

## Motivation

Why is statistics important?
 
- We have a research question we want to answer
	
- We hear a claim we think is false, and want to refute it
	
- We have a *lot* of information and we don't know how to make sense of it
	
- We understand the current state of things, but want to predict future outcomes
 

## Example: Research question

Retinol (a Vitamin A derivative) is a popular skin care agent that has been shown in studies to decrease wrinkle surface area and hyperpigmentation. However, retinol is not safe to use for pregant individuals, and additionally retinol has known side-effects of causing skin dryness and stinging for many people. Bakuchiol has been proposed as a retinol alternative that is safe for pregnant individuals to use and does not have similar negative side-effects. However, we are not sure if Bakuchiol is **as effective** as retinol for decreasing wrinkle surface area and hyperpigmentation. 

Q: **Is Bakuchiol** as effective as retinol for improving wrinkle surface area and hyperpigmentation?


How do we answer this question? (one option: [a randomized trial](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjd.16918) )

 

## Retinol Example Continued

 
- Randomly assign 44 individuals to either use Bakuchiol or Retinol over the course of 12 weeks, surveying individuals and taking images every 4 weeks 
- Use image analysis to determine fine wrinkle surface area at each time point


<p align="center">
 
 ![](retinol.png)
 
 </p>



 

## Retinol Example Continued

Why is statistics important?



In this example:
 
- Allows us to determine whether or not there is a difference in outcomes based on exposure (retinol vs. Bakuchiol) that is due to **the exposure alone** (i.e. no other variable could have mattered)
- A standardized way of measuring the outcome. This study didn't compare qualitatively if they thought individuals had a lower wrinkle surface area, they used image analysis!
- Allows us to determine if there is a **statistically significant** difference in outcomes between Bakuchiol and retinol users (we'll come back to this throughout the course)
 

 

## Example: Refuting a false claim

<p align="center">

![](lancet.png){width=85%}

</p>






## Example: Refuting a false claim

A paper published in the Lacet (a relatively high-impact journal!) in 1998 suggested that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine may cause autism spectrum disorder in children.

<p align="center">

![](mmrvax.jpg)
</p>
 

## Example: Refuting a false claim

Statistical tools used to critically assess (and eventually refute) this claim:
 
- The sample size in their study was $n = 12$ (which is *very* small)
- Their study design was uncontrolled, so causal claims could not be made 
 
## Example: Refuting a false claim

Why is statistics important?
 
- Allows us to critically assess scientific claims
- Understanding the assumptions underlying statistical methods and study designs lets us think **scientifically and statistically** about whether or not these assumptions are met
 

An important aside with this study: the lead author was funded by lawyers who had been representing parents in lawsuits against vaccine-producing companies. Critically reading studies from *many* angles (not only statistical) is important! A more detailed summary of this article and follow-up can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136032/).

 

## Example: Making sense of data

 
- Cholera outbreak in 1854 in London
- People were unsure where it was coming from (airborne? spread through food? from animals?)
- Informational available: where cholera patients lived
- A doctor, John Snow, decided to make a map...

## Example: Making sense of data

<p align="center">
![](cholera.png){width=85%}
</p>
 
## Example: Making sense of data


 - Mapping the cholera cases was the key to realizing the disease was spread through water, specifically the Broad Street pump
- An example of descriptive spatial statistics
 

Why is statistics important?
 
- Allows us to distinguish patterns in data that were previously unclear
- With this specific example, more advanced statistical methods could be used to detect clusters of points in space

## Example: Prediction

- Statistics influences public policy and our daily lives
- Care needs to be taken when developing prediction models
	 
    - Which covariates may be important predictors of the outcome?
    - Which covariates are extraneous and don't need to be included?
    - Are any of the covariates we include *problematic*, or may lead to conclusions that are socially unjust?
    - What social/political context should we consider when making the model?
	 
- Uncertainty needs to be appropriately calculated *and* reported
 
 

## Key Takeaway

Regression (the main focus of our course) is a statistical tool underlying *many* statistical problems, including some of the ones we just discussed!
